    <h3 style="color: white;">Story of mercedes-benz</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color: white;">The story of Mercedes-Benz begins with Karl Benz, who built the first gasoline-powered automobile in 1886 — the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Around the same time, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach were developing their own engines and vehicles in another part of Germany.

In 1901, Daimler’s company released a car named “Mercedes”, after Mercedes Jellinek, the daughter of a major investor and automobile enthusiast, Emil Jellinek. The name stuck.

In 1926, the two pioneering companies — Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft — merged to form Mercedes-Benz, symbolized by the iconic three-pointed star, representing dominance over land, sea, and air.

Since then, Mercedes-Benz has been known for luxury, innovation, and engineering — from producing some of the world’s most elegant cars to introducing safety and technology features that would become industry standards.

Today, Mercedes-Benz is one of the most recognized and respected car brands in the world, blending tradition with cutting-edge technology.</p>

    <p>The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated, hoofed mammal belonging to the family Equidae. Horses have evolved over millions of years from small multi-toed creatures into the large, single-toed animals we see today. They are known for their strength, speed, and ability to be trained for various tasks, including riding, work, and companionship. Horses come in numerous breeds, each with unique characteristics and uses.</p>
